Here is a description of stream buffers.

A TCP proxy sees two unidirectional streams :
  - one from the client to the server, called the REQUEST stream (req)
  - one from the server to the client, called the RESPONSE stream (rsp)

A stream is composed of :
  - a producer
  - a buffer
  - a reader

On the producer side, a stream buffer can :
  - get informed that a new connection occured
  - get informed that an end of session occured
  - enable reading of data
  - read data from the producer to the buffer
  - pause reading of data
  - time-out
  - shut down reading
